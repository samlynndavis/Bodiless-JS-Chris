# Bodiless Accessibility

Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high-quality
websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services. This package
(`@bodiless/accessibility`) includes a set of tools to run accessibility checks on the provided
`sitemap.xml` file or `url` using [Pa11y](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y ':target=_blank'). Pa11y is
your automated accessibility testing pal. It runs accessibility tests on your pages via the command
line or Node.js, so you can automate your testing process.

For information on using Pa11y with your BodilessJS site, please see: [Pa11y](./Pa11y).
