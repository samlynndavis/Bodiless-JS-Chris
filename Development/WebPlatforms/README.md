# Web Platforms

A BodilessJS site is, in essence, just a normal Gatsby site and as such it can be hosted
on a variety of platforms.  In this section, we provide step-by-step
instructions for hosting your production site on  

- [Netlify](./Netlify)
- [Gatsby Cloud](./GatsbyCloud.md)

We also provide instructions for hosting your edit environments in the cloud on

- [Platform.sh](./Platform.sh) (Note you will need to have installed the
  [@bodiless/psh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bodiless/psh) package as a
  dependency in order to view this documentation locally.

You may be able to host on other platforms as well, following similar processes.
