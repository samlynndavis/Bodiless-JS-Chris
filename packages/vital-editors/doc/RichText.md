# Vital Rich Text Editor Component

The Vital Rich Text Editor Component is based on the [BodilessJS Rich Text Editor
Component](/Components/Editors/RichText). While Bodiless Rich Text is a generic rich text editor
(RTE) component with tokens that can be combined however you choose, Vital Rich Text builds upon it,
providing a sensible default combination of its generic [Vital tokens](../VitalElements/), to help
meet typical site-use expectations.

By default, the only option available for the Vital Rich Text Editor is the _Full_ Rich Text Editor.

## Content Editor Details

Other than potentially seeing different buttons available, there is no change to the Editor
experience by the Vital Editor package, and, thus, you can refer to the [Bodiless Rich Text Editor :
Content Editor Details](/Components/Editors/RichText#content-editor-details).

### Usage of the Vital Rich Text Editor

What's shown in the following example can be applied to any Slot.
There are other available Editor Tokens, see next section.

```js
import { vitalRichText, RichTextClean } from '@bodiless/vital-editors';
import { asVitalTokenSpec } from '@bodiless/vital-elements';

const WithRichTextEditor = asVitalTokenSpec({
  Editors: {
    Content: as(vitalRichText.Default)(RichTextClean);
  },
  Schema: {
    Content: withNode('content'),
  }
});
```

We recommend that the Editor Component and tokens be defined in the Editors Domain, and the node be
defined in the Schema Domain.
