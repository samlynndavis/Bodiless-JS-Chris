### BREAKING CHANGES

- **navigation, organisms, components:** - There is now a new `@bodiless/navigation` package for the new menu API.

* All menu-related code is removed from `@bodiless/organisms`.
* `withSimpleMenuDesign` and `withMegaMenuDesign` were deprecated. Use `withMenuDesign` from `@bodiless/organisms` instead.
* `asSimpleMenuTopNav` and `asMegaMenuTopNav` were depricated. Use `asTopNav()` from `@bodiless/organisms` instead.
* Breadcrumbs are now configured by default for each menu item. No need for `asBreadcrumbSource`.
* List and Menu design keys have changed. Removed extra `Wrapper` component from submenus.
* Breadcrumb design keys have changed. Breadcrumb `Title` is now the same component as `MenuTitle` by default. The `BreadcrumbLink` design key has been deprecated. `Link` is available in `MenuTitle`. Renamed `BreadcrumbWrapper` and `BreadcrumbItem` to `Wrapper` and `Item` respectively.
* Please refer to the Upgrade Guide in `@bodiless/organisms` readme file.

## [0.0.55](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/bodiless-js/compare/v0.0.54...v0.0.55) (2020-08-28)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **fclasses:** chaining support is removed from addClasses and removeClasses. If your code contains chained addClasses/removeClasses, you need to replace the chaining with flow/flowIf or any other helpers that provides functional composition.
  For example, when you have in your code

```
addClasses('classA').removeClasses('classB')
```

you need to change it to

```
flow(
  addClasses('classA'),
  removeClasses('classB'),
)
```
