# CanvasX Component Template

Every component/package in the CanvasX design system (or one which extends it)
should follow these conventions.

## File structure

Packages defining CanvasX components and/or tokens should use the following
file structure.
```
package.json
tsconfig.json
bodiless.docs.json
/doc
/src
    index.ts
    /components
        /{Component}
            index.ts
            index.bl-edit.ts 
            index.static.ts
            {Component}Clean.tsx
            tokens/
              index.ts
              {brand}{Component}.ts
```
THis structure is intended to facilitate two build-time webpack optimizations:
- [Static Token Replacement](#static-token-replacement): Removes unnecessary code
  from the production bundle.
- [Token shadowing](#token-shadowing): Allows a downstream package to define an
  override of any CanvasX token collection.

The files and directories are described in more detail below:

### Component Level files

#### `{Component}Clean.tsx`

Provides the clean component (if any) as a default export. It should also export
the type of the component's design keys ("slots"), and an `as...Token` function
used to create token specifications. For example:

**File `FooClean.tsx`:**

```ts
import React from 'react';
import type { ComponentOrTag, DesignableComponentsProps } from '@bodiless/fclasses';
import { Div, Fragment, designable } from '@bodiless/fclasses';
import type { FC } from 'react';
import { asCxTokenSpec } from '@bodiless/cx-elements';

export type FooComponents = {
  Wrapper: ComponentOrTag<any>,
  Body: ComponentOrTag<any>,
};

const FooBase: FC<DesignableComponentsProps<FooComponents>> = ({ components: C, ...rest }) => (
  <C.Wrapper {...rest}>
    <C.Body />
  <C.Wrapper>
);

const fooComponents: FooComponents = {
  Wrapper: Div,
  Body: Fragment,
};

export default designable(fooComponents, 'Foo')(FooBase);
export const asFooToken = asCxTokenSpec<FooComponents>();
```

> In some cases, there will be no clean component; for example, if a package is
> merely providing tokens for a component defined elsewhere.

#### `tokens/{brand}{Component}.ts`

Provides the component's token collection as a default export. For example:

**File `cxFoo.ts`**

```js
const Default = asFooToken({ ... });
const Special - asFooToken({ ... });
// A token which is intended to be composed with other tokens should be prefixed with 'With...'
const WithSomething = asFooToken({ ... });

export default { Default, Special, WithSomething };
```

May extend a token collection from another package, for example:

```js
import { otherFooBase } from 'some-package';
const Default = asFooToken(otherFooBase.Default, { ...})
export default { ...otherFooBase, Default };
```
> Note here we extend `otherFooBase` and **not** `otherFoo`.  This is to allow shadowing
> of `otherFoo` (see below).

#### `tokens/index.ts`

Simply re-exports the token collection defined in `{brandComponent}.ts`:

```js
import tokens from './cxFoo';

export default tokens;
```


#### `index.bl-edit.ts`

Export the clean component and token collection, including a "Base" version of the token
collection.

```js
export { default as FooClean } from './FooClean';
// Note this export will be shadowable.
export { default as mybrandFoo } from './tokens';
```

Note, in many cases you will also want to export a static version of your token
collection:

```js
export { default as FooClean } from './FooClean';
export {
  default as mybrandFoo,
  default as mybrandFooStatic
} from './tokens';
```

This is useful when your component adds significant weight to the bundle (ususally
through its dependencies), and you are not sure whether the children of your component
will need to be hydrated in the browser.  See [Static Replacement](static-replacement)
below for more information.

#### 'index.static.ts`

If your token is always static, export empty versions of the token and clean component:

```js
import {
  staticTokenCollection as mybrandFoo,
  StaticComponent as FooClean,
} from '@bodiless/hydration';

export { FooClean, mybrandFoo };
```

If you have both static and a dynamic versions of your token:

```js
import { staticTokenCollection  as mybrandFooStatic } from '@bodiless/hydration';

export { mybrandFooStatic };
export { default mybrandFoo } from './tokens';
export { default as FooClean } from './FooClean';
```

> If your token does not have a static version, omit this file.

#### `index.ts`

Re-export everything from `index.bl-edit.ts`, along with any other utilities or types.
Also export the "Base" version of the token collection directly from its location.

```js
export { asFooToken, FooComponents } from './FooClean';
// This export will not be shadowable.
export { default as mybrandFooBase } from './tokens/cxFoo';
// ... any other exports or utilities.

// These exports will be excluded from the static bundle
export * from './index.bl-edit';
```

### Top level

#### `package.json`
This should include, at a minimum, the following keys:
- **name**. Should be namespaced to `@bodiless` for CanvasX packages.
- **version**. This field is managed by lerna.  Currently all bodiless packages
- **license**. Set to `Apache 2.0` for all Bodiless packages.
  maintain a common version line.
- **description**
- **author**
- **repository**.
- **files**. Be sure to include all resources exported by the package.
- **sideEffects**. Usually set to `false` unless your package has them.
- **main**. Usually `./lib/index.js`
- **typings**. Usually `./lib/index.d.ts`
- **scripts**. Usually the following should suffice:
  ```json
    "build": "run-p build:lib build:api-doc",
    "build:api-doc": "typedoc --out doc/api src",
    "build:lib": "tsc -p ./tsconfig.json",
    "build:watch": "npm run build:lib -- --watch",
    "clean": "rimraf \"lib/*\" && rimraf tsconfig.tsbuildinfo && rimraf \"doc/api\"",
  ```
  Do not include lint or test scripts as these are generally defined at monorepo root.
- **dependencies**, **peerDependencies**.  List only packages which are specifically
  required.

### `index.ts` (top level)

Expose exports from all components, 
```ts
export * from './components/{ComponentA}';
export * from './components/{ComponentB}';
// ... additional utilities or types defined in your package.
...
```

## Static Replacements

Bodiless supports a performance optimization which helps remove unused code from
your production bundle through selective hydration. There are two supported
use-cases:
- Components which *never* need to be hydrated (those that do not contain any
  interactivity, and require React only for editing and/or rendering). Examples
  are *text fields* (with plain or rich text editors) and *images*.
- Components which *sometimes* need to be hydrated (those whose children may
  require React for interactivity in the browser). Examples are *links*,
  *cards*, etc.
  
Note that this technique does not apply to components which *always* need to be
hydrated (*search*, *product filters*, etc).

Both supported use-cases are implemented by following the following steps:
- Add the bodiless static file replacement plugin to your webpack configuration
  using the `addStaticReplacementPlugin` function from `@bodiless/webpack`:
  ```
  const newConfig = addStaticReplacementPlugin(existingConfig);
  ```
  This should be added only when building production bundles, and *must not* be
  added for server-side rendering.

  **Note: you can skip this step when using `gatsby-theme-bodiless`***

- Create an `index.bl-edit.ts` and matching `index.static.ts` at the top level
  of each component. different depending on whether the component/tokens may
  *sometimes* require hydration.

### Components which *never* require hydration

For these components, you will need to do the following. *(Note: in the examples
below replace `MyComponent` with the name of your component, and `mybrand` with
the name of your brand or design system.)*
- Ensure the clean version of your component is wrapped in the bodiless
  `withoutHydration` HOC. In your `MyComponentClean.tsx`
  ```
  import { withoutHydration } from '@bodiless/hydration';
  // Define your base clean component as usual.
  const MyComponentClean$ = ...;
  // wrap in withoutHydration
  export const MyComponentClean = withoutHydration(MyComponentClean$);
  ```
- Export normal versions of the component and its token collection in your
  `index.bl-edit.ts`:
  ```
  export { default as MyComponentClean } from './MyComponentClean';
  export { default as mybrandMyComponent } from './tokens';
  // Be sure to include any other exports
  export { asComponentToken, ... } from './ComponentClean';

- Export static versions of the component and its token collection. In your
  `index.static.ts`:
  ```
  export { StaticComponent as MyComponentClean } from '@bodiless/hydration';
  export { staticTokenCollection as mybrandMyComponent } from './tokens';
  // Be sure to include any other exports which should not be removed in static mode.
  export { asComponentToken, ... } from './ComponentClean';
  ```
  > You may want to collect exports (if any) which should not be replaced in
  > static mode into a common file which can be included in both `index.ts` and
  > `index.static.ts`.

- Add an `index.ts` file which just exports everything from `index.bl-edit.ts`:
  ```
  export * from './index.bl-edit';
  ```

Now, when the production bundle is built, your `index.bl-edit.ts` will be
replaced by `index.static.ts`, which will cause all your component and token
code (along with its dependencies) to be excluded from the bundle.

## Token Shadowing

Bodiless provides a mechanism to override the tokens provided by a CanvasX
package, changing their effect wherever they are used in the CanvasX design
system. The method, known as "Token Shadowing" is similar to
[Gatsby Component Shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2019-04-29-component-shadowing/),
but more restrictive. In particular, only token collections are shadowable using
this technique, and the package to be shadowed must be structured specifically
to enable this feature.

### Creating a shadowable token collection

In order to be shadowable, a token collection must be the *default export* of
a module which is located at `.../{ComponentName}/tokens`, and this module
must itself be re-exported from the package by an index file which imports
it at the *exact path* `./tokens`.  For example:

**File `./lib/components/Foo/tokens.ts`**
```js
const Default = asFooToken({ ... });

export default { Default }; // Must be a default export.
```

**File `./lib/Foo/index.ts`**
```js
import cxFoo from './tokens';  // Must import from exactly this path.

export { cxFoo }; // Must be a named export.
```

**File './lib/components/index.ts**
```
export * from './components/Foo';
```

### Shadowing a token collection

To export a shadowed version of a token collection:

1. Add a module to your package which defines the shadowed token collection.  You may
   import the original token collection from its location in the source package.
   For example:

   **File `./lib/shadow/MyComponent.js`**
   ```js
   // Import the base collection from its original location. Note that it is
   // the default export.
   import cxFoo from 'base-package/lib/components/Foo/tokens';
   // *** NOT: import { cxFoo } from 'base-package';
  
   // Override one or more of the tokens in the base collection
   const SomeToken = asFooToken(tokens.SomeToken, { ... });
  
   // Default export is the overridden token collection.
   export default {
     ...baseTokens,
     SomeToken,
   };
   ```

2. place a file at your package root called 'shadow.js'.  This should export a
   single function which receives a component name and returns the *resolved* module
   shadowed version of the specified token collection. 

   **File `shadow.js`***
   ```js
   module.exports = component => {
     try {
       return require.resolve(`./lib/shadow/${component}`);
     } catch (e) {
       return false;
     }
   };
   ```

3. Add the bodiless `tokenShadowPlugin` to the webpack config used to build your site.
   Pass it a list of one or more resolvers which are exported from shadowing packages.
   For example, in the site's `gatsby-node.js`:

   ```js
   const { addTokenShadowPlugin } = require('@bodiless/webpack');
   const shadow = require('shadowing-package/shadow');
   const shadow2 = require('lower-priority-shadowing-package/shadow');

   module.exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ actions }) => {
     actions.setWebpackConfig(
       // The shadowed tokens will be loaded by the first shadow package
       //which returns a match.
       addTokenShadowPlugin({}, { resolvers: [shadow, shadow2] })
     );
   };
   ```

Some important notes:
- If you are extending a base token collection, be sure to import it from its
  original location as a default export, and not by name from the base package.
- Ensure that your token shadow resolver (`shadow.js`) uses CJS module syntax.
- Ensure that all resources directly required (including `shadow.js` and your original
  token file) are included in and exported by your package. In your `package.json`
  ```json
  ...
  "files": [
    ...,
    "./shadow.js"
  ],
  ```
  And, if you use the `exports` key:
  ```json
  ...
  "exports": {
    ...,
    "./shadow.js": "./shadow.js"
  }
  ```
