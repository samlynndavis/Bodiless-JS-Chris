# Vital Design System Curriculum

Welcome to the VitalDS learning curriculum. Here you will find what you need to get started working
with Vital and Bodiless.

## Before you start

To help you understand some of the foundational ideas of VitalDS and BodilessJS, and the problems
they were created to address, you may want to watch these introductory videos.  They are a bit
outdated, so some of the specific technical details may no longer apply, but they will help you to
understand the bigger picture:

- [Life After Drupal: Becoming BodilessJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10R0ppnIGY4

- [Introduction to BodilessJS a Gatsby based framework for editing
  websites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LBdqpscwi0 ':target=_blank') | YouTube

## Important Notes

- You will need a local development environment with NodeJS `v18.16` or higher.
- The working code for all these examples can be found in the
  [`@bodiless/vital-examples`](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/Bodiless-JS/tree/main/packages/vital-examples ':target=_blank')
  package and in the [`vital-examples`
  site](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/Bodiless-JS/tree/main/sites/vital-examples ':target=_blank').
- All components and tokens created in the examples are structured according to very specific
  conventions described in the [Component Template](../Guides/ComponentTemplate). Vital provides a
  scaffolding tool to help you create code which conforms to these conventions. You can and should
  use it when building each example:
  ```
  npx @bodiless/vital-scaffold@next
  ```
