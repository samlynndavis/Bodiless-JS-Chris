# Vital List Component

The Vital List Component is based on the [BodilessJS List Component](/Components/List). While
Bodiless List is a generic List component with tokens that can be combined however you choose, Vital
List builds upon it, providing a sensible default combination of its generic tokens (i.e., features
and styles), to help meet typical site-use expectations.

## Types of Lists

Vital List provides four categories of Lists:

- [Infographic](#infographic)
- [Links](#links)
- [Rich Text](#rich-text)
- [Plain Text](#plain-text)

Excluding Infographic Lists, each category offers the following variations:

- **Bullets:** A bulleted list, as you'd associate with a typical unordered list element (`<ul>`).
- **Numbers:** A numbered list, as you'd associate with a typical ordered list element (`<ol>`).
- **Undecorated:** A simple list without any item markers.

?> **Note:** Out of the box, Vital Lists are _single-level-only_ — i.e., they can't have nested
items. However, they do support multi-level (nested) lists if they're enabled by a Site Builder.

### Infographic

![Infographics List](./assets/InfographicList.jpg ':size=180')

Each list item in an Infographic List is composed of an [Image](/Components/Image/) and a title.

- The Image can be [selected and configured](/Components/Image/#select-and-configure-an-image) as
  you'd expect.
- Selecting text in the title will bring up the [Rich Text Editor](/Components/Editors/RichText)
  toolbar, allowing you to apply some basic formatting.
  - The formatting options provided by the RTE toolbar in the Infographic List are the same as those
    in the [Rich Text Lists](#rich-text).

### Links

| Bullets | Numbers | Undecorated |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-----------:|
| ![Links Bullets List](./assets/LinksBulletsList.jpg ':size=86') | ![Links Number List](./assets/LinksNumbersList.jpg ':size=88') | ![Links Undecorated List](./assets/LinksUndecoratedList.jpg ':size=72') |

Each list item in a Links List is a [Link](/Components/Link/), and is
[configurable](/Components/Link/#add-a-link-to-a-component) as such.

### Rich Text

| Bullets | Numbers | Undecorated |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-----------:|
| ![Rich Text Bullets List](./assets/RichTextBulletsList.jpg ':size=82') | ![Rich Text Numbers List](./assets/RichTextNumbersList.jpg ':size=84') | ![Rich Text Undecorated List](./assets/RichTextUndecoratedList.jpg ':size=67') |

The text in each list item in a Rich Text List is able to be formatted via the [Rich Text
Editor](/Components/Editors/RichText) toolbar. The available formatting options are shown below:

### Plain Text

| Bullets | Numbers | Undecorated |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-----------:|
| ![Plain Text Bullets List](./assets/PlainTextBulletsList.jpg ':size=82') | ![Plain Text Numbers List](./assets/PlainTextNumbersList.jpg ':size=84') | ![Plain Text Undecorated List](./assets/PlainTextUndecoratedList.jpg ':size=67') |

The Plain Text List is the most basic of the Vital Lists, with each list item being in plain
(unformatted) text.
