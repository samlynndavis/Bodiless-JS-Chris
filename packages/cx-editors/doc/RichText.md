# CanvasX Rich Text Editor Component

The CanvasX Rich Text Editor Component is based on the [BodilessJS Rich Text Editor
Component](/Components/Editors/RichText). While Bodiless Rich Text is a generic rich text editor
(RTE) component with tokens that can be combined however you choose, CX Rich Text builds upon it,
providing a sensible default combination of its generic [CanvasX tokens](../../CX_Elements/), to
help meet typical site-use expectations.

By default, the only option available for the CX Rich Text Editor is the _Full_ Rich Text Editor.

## Content Editor Details

Other than potentially seeing different buttons available, there is no change to the Editor
experience by the CX Editor package, and, thus, you can refer to the [Bodiless Rich Text Editor :
Content Editor Details](../RichText#content-editor-details).

## Site Builder Details

### Usage of the CX Rich Text Editor

What's shown in the following example can be applied to any Slot.

```js
import { cxRichText, RichTextClean } from '@bodiless/cx-editors';
import { asCxTokenSpec } from '@bodiless/cx-elements';

const WithRichTextEditor = asCxTokenSpec({
  Editors: {
    Content: as(cxRichText.Default)(RichTextClean);
  },
  Schema: {
    Content: withNode('content'),
  }
});
```

We recommend that the Editor Component and tokens be defined in the Editors Domain, and the node be
defined in the Schema Domain.

### Overriding Rich Text Editor

#### Via Shadowing (*Preferred Method)

Provide the Shadowing function as defined in [Shadow](../../CX_Elements/CX_Shadow).

File to shadow:
[`cxRichText`](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/Bodiless-JS/blob/main/packages/cx-editors/src/components/RichText/tokens/cxRichText.ts)

#### Via Overriding Specific Existing Styles Using CanvasX Rich Text Editor

See [CanvasX Site Typography](../../CX_Elements/CX_SiteTypography).

### Extending Default CanvasX Rich Text Editor

At site or global regional/brand library level, a site can compose a set of new tokens to meet the
design requirements, and provide additional Rich Text functionality (typically, via buttons).

01. Create a `src/components/Editors/RichText.tokens.ts` where you can create/use your site/brand
    specific tokens for each. (`import` and `export` as needed.)

    ```js
    const withQuoteBlockMeta = flowHoc(
      startWith(Span),
      withButton('format_quote'),
    );

    const BrandRichText = asCxTokenSpec()({
      ...cxRichText.Default,
      Core: {
        ...cxRichText.Default.Core,
        Quote: withQuoteBlockMeta,
      },
      Components: {
        ...cxRichText.Default.Components,
        Quote: 'italic',
      },
    });
    ```

    - `withQuoteBlockMeta` creates a token that will be a designable Span and adds a new quote
      button to the editor.
    - `BrandRichText` starts with the existing `cxRichText` functionality, and, in both
      Core/Components, it spreads existing functionality across these two domains and the new tokens
      are added.
    - For an example of a simple token that adds functionality to Slate, expand the disclosure
      below:

      <details>
        <summary>Click here for example...</summary>

        ```js
        const withQuoteBlockMeta = t(
          asBlock,
          withButton('format_quote'),
        );

        //...

        const EditorWithBlockQuote = asTokenSpec()({
          ...cxDefault,
          Core: {
            ...cxDefault.Core,
            BlockQuote: t(replaceWith(BlockQuote), asBlockQuote, withQuoteBlockMeta),
          }
        });
        ```

      </details>

01. Create a `src/components/Editors/index.tsx`  where you can export all tokens and schemas from
    Editors.

    ```js
    export BrandRichText from './RichText.tokens';
    ```
