When you click the **New** button, the _Add a Blank Page_ form will open, and you will be prompted
to enter the URL you wish to use for the new page.

Above the _URL_ field, you will see a read-only _Template_ field. In BodilessJS, pages utilize
[templates](/Development/Guides/BuildingSites/Templates/). Developers use templates to define page
layouts in order to maintain uniformity and consistency across content types and sections.

A page is added to the section in which it was created, and the newly created page will use the
[template](/Development/Guides/BuildingSites/Templates/) associated with that section.

To create a new page:

01. From the [Toolbar](../../#toolbar), click **Page > New** to open the _Add a Blank Page_ form.

01. In the _URL_ field, enter the URL you wish to use for the new page, and click the checkmark to
    confirm.
    * A spinner will appear while your new page is being created.

01. Once your page is created, you will see an "Operation Complete" confirmation, along with a link
    to the new page.
