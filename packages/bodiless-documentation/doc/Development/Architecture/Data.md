# Data and Page Generation

## Overview

Most components will consume and render some *data* (content and/or
configuration). For example, a link component might take a target href, some
link text, etc. and render a clickable link on the page. A "where to buy"
component might take a product ID and some credentials for an external service,
and render a list of online retailers. In an ordinary react app, such data might
be passed as props to the component. In Bodiless, components usually provide an
interface to edit the data they render, so the data are part of the application
state.

Rather than requiring each component to manage its own state, Bodiless provides
a central store and serialization mechanism. Components are allocated a slot in
that central store where they can read and write the data they need. Each
component is responsible for the structure of its own data, while the store is
responsible for:
- serializing/deserializing data for all components to and from JSON files on
  the edit server
- managing data which are shared among components,
- tracking changes globally (for example, to allow for undo/redo).

Note that the ability to edit content is limited to the edit environment. When
Bodiless renders the static site for production, the global store is effectively
immutable, and components simply consume the data therein.

## Flow

The following diagram illustrates the flow of data in the edit environment.

![Data Flow](assets/data.jpg)

1. Component data are stored in json files on the (local or public) edit server.
   There is a single file for each component, and all data files for a given
   page are kept together in a single directory under `~/src/data/pages`. The
   name of each file corresponds to a key in the store which uniquely identifies
   the component to which the data belong.

2. The Gatsby development server -- or, more properly, the
   [Gatsby Filesystem Plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem)
   -- watches the filesystem for changes in the data. When a change is detected,
   Gatsby executes a page query and sends the results over a websocket to the
   browser. There, they are provided as a "data" prop to the top level page
   component. For more information, see
   [the Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-four/).

3. The data provided by Gatsby consist of the contents of all json files in the
   directory which corresponds to the current page. These are processed into a
   key-value store (a JS map) keyed by the filename. The elements of this map
   are Mobx observables, so when they are updated they trigger any observer
   component to re-render. As a result, we explicity prevent update of the main
   page component, which would otherwise re-render itself and all children
   whenever a json file was modified. Note also that we compare the incoming
   data from Gatsby to the data already in the store, and only update if it has
   changed.

4. We refer to each element in the store as a "node", and each is represented by
   an instance of the `DefaultContentNode` class. A ContentNode is placed in a
   context which can be access by `useNode()`. The component can then read and
   write to the store via the node's data property.

5. The store also defines a Mobx _reaction_ which listens for changes. When a
   component updates its data. The reaction invokes a `BackendClient` to post
   the updated node to a ligthweight express server which in turn serialized the
   data to json.

6. The backend server is also responsible for managing the git repository which
   contains all code and content for the site, and exposes endpoints to commit
   changes and push them to an upstream remote _Note the client-side
   functionality to consume these endpoints is not yet implemented.

## Working with Data

### Creating Pages

By default, Gatsby creates a page for every component it finds in the
`/src/pages/` directory. Bodiless extends this to create pages recursively for
every directory located under `~/src/data/pages`. Thus, to create a new page,
simply create a new directory or subdirectory there. The URL path to your page
will be the same as its relative path under `~/src/data/pages`. For example, a
directory at `~/src/data/pages/foo/bar` will result in a page at
`http://mysite.com/foo/bar/`.

You can include an index.json file if you wish to specify templates to use for
the page level components of the given page and/or its subpages, eg:
```json
{
    "#template": "mytemplate",
    "#subpage_template": "mysubpagetemplate",
}
```
The templates should be specified as paths relative to `~/src/templates` and
should refer to a React page component, without the jsx extension. If
`#template` key is omitted in the page index.json, then Bodiless will use
template specified in `#subpage_template` of the closest ancestor of the page.
If closest ancestor does not have `#subpage_template`, then the default template
(`~/src/templates/_default.jsx`) will be used.

Alternatively, for one-off pages, you can include an "index.jsx" file containing
the page level component.

If you provide neither index.json nor a page component, 404 page will be returned.

This can/should be customized to fit the needs of your site.

### Page Data

In order to take advantage of the Bodiless data flow, your page-level component
(or template) should use `Page`, and should export the default page query. the
`default template` is a good example and can be copied to form the basis of your
pages.

Note that the Gatsby page query exported by the default template uses a GraphQL
"fragment":

```javascript
export const query = graphql`
  query($slug: String!) {
    ...PageQuery,
    ...SiteQuery
  }
`;
```

The fragment is defined by Gatsby Theme Bodiless and queries the contents of all
json files in the directory corresponding to the page. This can be used as-is,
or the page query could be extended in case the page requries additional data.

### Component Data

Page provides a root node to the node context which initializes the store and
provides a base ContentNode instance in to the Context. Components that need a
node should wrap themselves in `withNode`. When supplied with a `nodeKey` prop,
this will provide each of them with a new `ContentNode` identified by that key.
The node can then be accessed via the `useNode` hook.

```javascript
const ComponentWithData = withNode(
  props => {
    const { node } = useNode();
    return (<span {...props}>{node.data}</span>);
  }
);
export default (props: any) => (
  <Page {...props}>
    <Layout>
      <h1>Default Page</h1>
      <ComponentWithData nodeKey="content" />
    </Layout>
  </Page>
);
 ```

 Note that the ContentNode instance does not store any data; it is simply an
 interface which points to a particular "slot" in the global store. The actual
 storage and retrieval of data are handled by the store's getter and setter
 methods which are injected into the ContentNode constructor (this happens
 within `GatsbyNodeProvider::getRootNode()`).

 ### Node Hierarchy

 While the store itself is a flat set of key-value pairs, the ContentNode
 interface provides a mechanism for creating a hierarchy of content nodes which
 mirrors the component hierarchy. The key names are actually built as *paths*,
 and `ContentNode` provides a `child()` method which will create a new node
 within the namespace of the parent. This allows compound components to name the
 nodes used by their children uniquely on the page by using the nodeKey prop:

 ```javascript
const Blurb =  withNode(
  props => (
    <div>
      <h2><ComponentWithData nodeKey="title" />
      <div>
        <ComponentWithData nodeKey="body" />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
);
```
Now you can place multiple instances of your blurb on the page, each with an independent
title and body.

```javascript
export default (props: any) => (
  <Page {...props}>
    <Layout>
      <h1>Default Page</h1>
      <Blurb nodeKey="blurb-1" />
      <Blurb nodeKey="blurb-2" />
    </Layout>
  </Page>
);
```

### Nodes and the Filesystem

As described above, Bodiless Content Nodes are backed by JSON files in your
repository (although this is a pluggable mechanism, and you could easily build a
store backed by some other persistant storage, like a database). Each node has
its own file within the directory corresponding to the current page.  The filename
is created by concatenating all segments of the node's path using the dollar sign ($).

So, in the above example, there would be 4 files:
```
  blurb-1$title.json
  blurb-1$body.json
  blurb-2$title.json
  blurb-2$body.json
```

### "Sidecar" nodes.

There are some cases in which having the data model mirror the component hierarchy
can be undesirable. For example, suppose we wanted to enhance our component above
to add an `aria-label` attribute whose text was stored as content:
```
const ComponentWithAriaLabel = withNode(
  props => <ComponentWithData {...props} aria-label={useNode().node.data} />
);
```
Or, better, you could encapsulate this enahncement in a simple, reusable HOC.
```
const withAriaLabel = Component => withNode(
  props => (<Component {...props} aria-label={useNode().node.data} />)
);
```
And then
```
const ComponentWithAriaLabel = withAriaLabel(ComponentWithData);
...
<ComponentWithAriaLabel nodeKey="content" />
```

The problem with the above is that the component managing the `aria-label` and
the original component end up using the same node to store their data.
`withNode()` only creates a new node if a `nodeKey` prop is specified, and we
are only specifying a `nodeKey` to the outer component.

This could be solved by ensuring that our aria-label component provides a
`nodeKey` to its child:
```
const withAriaLabel = Component => withNode(
  props => (<Component nodeKey="component" {...props} aria-label={useNode().node.data} />)
);
```
This will work, but consider the resulting node hierarchy:
```
content.json // This contains the aria-label data
content$component.json // This contains the actual content of the original component.
```
The original component's data are now stored as a child of the aria-label, which
seems backwards. And it's worse if the original component had already been
placed on a site and was rendering actual data. When replaced with the enhanced
component, it's existing data (at `content.json`) will be used forthe
aria-label, and the actual text displayed on the screen will be lost.

What we really want to to attach the aria-label data alongside the original
component. This will leave the original data intact and give us a more rational
hierarchy. To achieve this, Bodiless provides the notion of a sidecar node:
```
const ComponentWithAriaLabel = withSidecarNodes(
  withNodeKey('aria-label'),
  withAriaLabel,
)(ComponentWithData);
```
In effect, this creates a sub-hierarchy off of the current node which is used
for all the enclosed enhancements. The resulting hierarchy makes much more
sense:
```
content.json // contains the orignial content.
aria-label.json // contains the aria-label data.

If you wanted to bundle these together, you could create a parent node which owns both:
```
const ComponentWithAriaLabel = flowRight(
  withNode,
  withSidecarNodes(
    withNodeKey('aria-label'),
    withAriaLabel,
  ),
  withNodeKey('component'),
)(ComponentWithData);
```
giving
```
content$aria-label.json
content$component.json
```

### Component Data Composition

The examples above can be refactored to make them more composable.

Instead of defining our `ComponentWithData` as a Component, we can abstract that functionality
to an HOC (a very common pattern in BodilessJS).
```
const asComponentWithData = BaseComponent => {
  const ComponentWIthData = props => (
    <BaseComponent {...props}>
      {useNode().node.data}
    </BaseComponent>
  );
  ComponentWithData.displayName = 'ComponentWithData';
  return ComponentWithData;
};
export default nodeKey => flowRight(
  withNodeKey(nodeKey),
  withNode,
  asComponentWithData,
);
```

Note the use of `withNodeKey()` in the above. This is simply providing a shorthand way
to provide our enhancement with a node key.
```
const Blurb1 = withNodeKey('blurb-1');
...
<Blurb1 />
```
is equivalent to
```
<Blurb nodeKey="blurb-1" />
```

This pattern becomes particularly powerful when enhancing a compound component using
the [Design API](../FClasses). Assuming we made blurb "designable", we could
easily create a "behavioral token" which adds data:

```javascript
const asBlurbWithData = flow(
  withNode, 
  withDesign({
    Title: asComponentWithData('title'),
    Body: asComponentWithData('body'),
  }
);
```
