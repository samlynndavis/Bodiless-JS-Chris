# Components & Templates that come in the Bodiless starter

Let's discuss a few of these components/templates that are contained within the Bodiless starter:

## Layout

These components consist of the global components

* Header `src/components/Layout/header.tsx`
* Footer `src/components/Layout/footer.tsx`
* Meta `src/components/Layout/meta.tsx`
* Logo `src/components/Layout/logo.tsx`
* Layout `src/components/Layout/index.tsx`
  * This file bring together header & footer into the page layout & composes the
    metadata of the page.

These components work as-is out of the Bodiless starter but site builder may
have to adjust their tokens (styling) to meet the designs of the site.

### MetaData Component

Bodiless provides a set of HOC's which work with react-helmet to place editable
meta-tags in the document HEAD.  A Site Builder can find examples of adding editable or
non-editable (static) meta data into head section from
`src/components/Layout/meta.tsx`.

For full code, please
[review code](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/Bodiless-JS/tree/main/examples/starter/src/components/Layout/meta.tsx).

See below for instructions on how to add meta data to a page's head and make it editable for site
editors.

- #### Adding SEO form to Editor interface
  The `withMetaForm` provides ability to insert a SEO form
within the editor interface for the site editor to manipulate meta data per
page.

  First, import `withMetaForm` from @bodiless/components package:
  ```
  import withMetaForm from @bodiless/components;
  ```
  `withMetaForm` takes 2 parameters:
  1. `useMenuOptions`: defines SEO form menu button appearance.
      ```
      {
        name: 'seo',                     // Menu item name
        isHidden: () => !context.isEdit, // Hidden the button in preview mode
        icon: 'category',                // Button icon
        label: 'SEO',                    // Button label
      },
      ```
  1. `seoFormHeader`: [Optional] defines SEO form title and description for users.
      ```
      {
        title: 'SEO Data form',
        description: `Enter the page level data used for SEO ...`
      };
      ```
  Then, apply this HOC to Helmet component:
  ```
  const SeoHelmet = withMetaForm(useMenuOptions, seoFormHeader)(Helmet);
  ```
- #### Adding Meta Data Fields to Editor interface
  Next, define the form fields so site editor can update content of meta data displayed
  on the head section of each page. For example, to add editable meta description field:
  1. Import withMeta from '@bodiless/components'.
  1. Create HOC withMetaPageDescription with meta field name `description`, form
     field label `Description` and a placeholder text. e.g.:
      ```
      const withMetaPageDescription = withMeta({
        name: 'description',
        useFormElement: () => useMenuOptionUI().ComponentFormTextArea,
        label: 'Description',
        placeholder: 'Rec < 160 char',
      });
      ```
      ***useFormElement*** provides a function that returns a UI input component
      (e.g. "ComponentFormText", "ComponentFormTextArea", etc.).

  To apply this field to the meta form previously created, you can use flowRight:
  ``` 
  const SeoHelmet = flowRight(
    withMetaForm(useMenuOptions, seoFormHeader),
    asBodilessHelmet('meta'),
    withMetaPageDescription('description', ''),
  )(Helmet);
  ```
  ***asBodilessHelmet*** HOC specifies `meta` as nodeKey for server side
  storage, and the description content will be saved in data file named
  `meta$description.json`.
- #### Meta Data Rendering
  In addition to defining the form fields, the calls to `withMeta*` also render
  the meta-tags to the page document head, using data from the json files which were
  written by the editor. 
  
  The recommendation is the content editor can set the meta data per page, but the
  site-level meta is not exposed to content editor for modification. The reason being the
  site-level meta data is set once per site on the site build and changes very infrequently
  to never, so there is little need to allow a content editor to change this data.

### Logo

* The Logo is an editable image that can be uploaded in the editor.

### Favicon

* Favion size recommendation is:
  * at least as big as the largest icon being generated (512x512 by default).
  * square (if itâ€™s not, transparent bars will automatically be added to make it square)
  * of one of the following formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, TIFF, GIF or SVG.

The favicon path & image is currently defined in the starter kit to use `src/images/favicon.png`
and it uses
[gatsby-plugin-manifest](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-manifest/)
to generate a set of favicons for your site to use. For more information on
options, please read the documentation for
[gatsby-plugin-manifest](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-manifest/).

If desired, this can be overrode by specifying custom options within the site's
`gatsby-config.js`.

e.g.
```
const plugins = [
  {
    resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-manifest',
    options: {
      icon: 'src/images/favicon.png',
      legacy: false,
    },  
  },
];
```

### Addition of other components in the Header & Footer

Often there are other elements in the header/footer and they can be added by
manipulating these files. As site builder adds more components, remember the
header and footer are components that all pages will use, so the data for them
should be stored at site level. This can be done via specifying
`nodeCollection="site"`. For more information, read about
[Data](../../Development/Architecture/Data).

e.g.
```
asEditable({ nodeKey: 'copyright', nodeCollection: 'site' }, 'Insert Copyright', 'site')
```

## Menu & Burger Menu

The Bodiless starter comes with a menu that is placed in the header. It is a menu with which the
data is shared site-wide, so that all pages use the same menu data. In addition, the burger menu
(mobile) generates its menu off this desktop menu's data. For more details, please see:
[Menu](/Components/Navigation/Menu) and [Burger Menu](/Components/Navigation/BurgerMenu).

## Editors

The Bodiless starter comes with pre-defined editors that can be changed and/or extended to meet the
site requirements. The Site Builder will find three pre-defined rich text editors:

* **Simple:** Superscript only.
* **Basic:** Superscript, Bold, Italic, Underline, Link, and Align Text.
* **Full:** Adds more functionality to Basic, such as Strikethru, Headers, and Quotes.

Editors can be extended or customized by using the Bodiless Design API to apply token HOCs which
add, remove, replace, or style the components which render different text formatting.

We recommend [refining the editor components](/Components/Editors/RichText#richtext-component)
needed to meet your site's requirements.

## Images

The starter kit contains simple editable images that render either linkable or non-linkable images,
and a few variations of image placeholders.

For more information, please read: [Image](/Components/Image/).

## Cards

Most sites use some form of Cards. (A block that consists of Image, Title, Body
and Call to Action) The Bodiless starter comes with this basic form defined in
`src/components/Card`. These can be used as is and/or extended to meet
the site design requirements. This component has its own set of tokens as well
for its different variations.

## Flow Container

The Flow Container component is a layout component that allows a content editor
to select from a set of components, place them on the page, and resize them.

Site builder can define set of component variations available to be placed in
any particular FlowContainer. The starter kit provides a starting point which
contains the example components described above (Editors, Images and Cards). As
with editors, site builder can use the design api to add, remove, replace or
style these variations. In addition, she can create different FlowContainers to
control what components may be placed in different areas of sites. e.g. A
FlowContainer for a sidebar could have reduced set of components to select from.
A FlowContainer can also be configured to use the Content Library, allowing
editors to save components for reuse throughout the site.

For more information, please read [FlowContainer](/Components/FlowContainer/).

## Sitemap.xml & Robots.txt file

Following best practices, the site will automatically render the sitemap.xml &
robots.txt file.

## Templates
A default page template using a FlowContainer can be found in
`src/templates/_default.jsx`.
