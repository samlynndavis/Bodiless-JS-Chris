# CX Link Component

The CX Link Component is based on the [BodilessJS Link Component](../../Components/Link/). While
Bodiless Link is a generic Link component with tokens that can be combined however you choose, CX
Link builds upon it, providing a sensible default combination of its generic tokens (i.e., features
and styles), to help meet typical site-use expectations.

- Provides an Editable Link component;
- Detects if the link points to an external URL or a downloadable file, and adds an appropriate icon
  automatically;
- Includes accessibility description; and
- Uses Bodiless `EditableLink` under the hood.

## Content Editor Details

As the Editor experience will be unchanged, you can refer to [Link Component : Content Editor
Details](/Components/Link/#content-editor-details) for instructions on use.

?> **Note:** For accessibility reasons, if you're adding a Link to an external URL or a downloadable
file, it's recommended that you provide an `aria-label`.

## Site Builder Details
### Usage

```jsx
import flow from 'lodash/flow';
import {
  Link as LinkBase,
} from '@bodiless/cx-link';

const asLink = addClasses('underlined text-blue');

const Link = flow(
  Wrapper: asLink,
)(LinkBase);

<Link nodeKey="link1">CX Link</Link>
```

The Link will detect if its `href` attribute has a value starting with `http` or `https` or `//` and
will add an appropriate icon automatically.

A Site Builder can change the way of detecting if the link is external by providing
`externalLinkFilter` prop.

```jsx
const externalLinkCustomFilter = (href: string) => href.includes('example');

<EditableLink nodeKey="link2" externalLinkFilter={externalLinkCustomFilter}>
  CX Link with a custom filter
</EditableLink>
```
