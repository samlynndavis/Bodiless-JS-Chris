Metadata is used by search engines (such as Google) to understand information about a webpage.
Search engines can use this information for ranking purposes or to display snippets in search
results. The **SEO** button offers an interface so that you can manage your site's metadata. Here,
you can enter a page's _Title_, _Description_, and _Page Type_, so that your page's search engine
result page will be as effective as possible.
