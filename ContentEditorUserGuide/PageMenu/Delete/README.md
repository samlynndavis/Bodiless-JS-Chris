# Delete Page

From the [_Page_ menu](../), click the **Delete** button to delete the current page.

If desired, the delete operation can also create a 301 redirect, sending users from the path/URL of
the deleted page to one of your choosing.

To delete a page:

01. From the page you wish to delete, click **Page > Delete** to open the _Delete Page_ form.
    ![Delete Page form](./assets/PageDeletePage.jpg ':size=65%')
01. If you want your users to be sent to a different page when they attempt to go to the path/URL of
    the deleted page, enter the desired path/URL of the redirect into the _Add optional redirect_
    field.
    * This will create a redirect with an HTTP response status code of `301`; if you want to create
      a redirect with a different status code, you can use the [Aliases](../../ToolsMenu/Aliases/)
      tool.
    * **Note:** Spaces are not allowed in the redirect path/URL.
01. Click the checkmark to confirm. (Or click the "X" icon to cancel.)
    * A spinner will appear while your page is being deleted.
    * If successful, you will see a confirmation message, and, upon closing it, you'll be redirected
      to the deleted page's parent page.

    * If unsuccessful, an error message will display, informing you of the issue.  
      For more information, see the [Error Messages](#error-messages) section below.

?> **Technical Note:** Using the **Delete** operation will delete the page and its associated JSON
data. Image media and other items, however, will _not_ be deleted (i.e., they will continue to
persist in the system). This persistence is especially relevant when these items are being used on
other pages.
